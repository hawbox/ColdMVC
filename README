Description
ColdMVC is a convention based MVC framework for ColdFusion 9 loosely based on concepts from Ruby on Rails and Grails.

Operating System
I've written everything using Windows 7, although things should work fine on a Mac. If they don't, let me know.

ColdFusion Server
ColdMVC was written specifically for Adobe ColdFusion 9. I don't believe it will work on any other platforms without full support for Hibernate ORM.

Installation
	1. Download ColdMVC
	2. Create a server mapping in ColdFusion administrator for ColdMVC or put it your server's webroot
	3. Create a new ColdFusion project
	4. Create a new datasource in ColdFusion administrator with the same name as your project
	5. Start building your applications

For further guidance, check out the sample applications located at https://github.com/tonynelson19/ColdMVC-Samples.

Documentation
I'll try to get more documentation available when I can, but admittedly it's not a very high priority for me right now. If anyone would like to help out, I'd appreciate it.

Bugs
If you find a bug, you can either log it on GitHub (http://github.com/tonynelson19/ColdMVC/issues) or contact me directly via email or twitter, or post a message on the Google group.

Future Plans
I'll try to update things when I can. I'm open to feature requests, so feel free to contact me.
